# 🔐 Remotely Docker Auto-Installer with HTTPS (via Caddy)

This one-click shell script will **automatically install and configure Remotely** (a self-hosted remote support tool) using Docker and Caddy with **HTTPS enabled**, even **without a domain name**.

## 📦 What This Script Does

- ✅ Installs **Docker** and **Docker Compose**
- ✅ Downloads and configures the latest **Remotely Docker image**
- ✅ Sets up **Caddy** as a reverse proxy with **TLS encryption**
- ✅ Uses your **server's IP address** instead of a domain
- ✅ Automatically stops anything using ports `80` or `443`
- ✅ Launches everything with a valid HTTPS setup
